## Data Exploration Summary

This summary outlines potential data quality issues and highlights fields that may require further clarification.

### 1. **User Data**

#### Quality Issues
- **Missing Values:** The fields `BIRTH_DATE`, `STATE`, `LANGUAGE`, and `GENDER` have incomplete data. Addressing these gaps through validation and enrichment can improve data completeness.
- **Value Inconsistencies:** The `GENDER` column contains inconsistent values (e.g., "Prefer not to say" vs. "prefer_not_to_say"), which can impact data integrity. Standardizing inputs and implementing validation mechanisms can enhance consistency.

#### Unclear Columns
- **`CREATED_DATE`:** The purpose of `CREATED_DATE` is unclearâ€”whether it represents account creation, profile updates, or another event needs clarification.
- **Language Codes:** The use of codes like `es-419` may need additional context.

### 2. **Transaction Data**

#### Quality Issues
- **Inconsistent `FINAL_QUANTITY`:** Some entries contain "zero" instead of numeric values. Standardizing these to `0` is an option.
- **Missing Values:** Fields such as `FINAL_SALE`, `USER_ID`, and `BARCODE` contain missing data, which may impact analysis accuracy.
- **Store Name Variations:** The `STORE_NAME` field has inconsistencies (e.g., "PRICE CUTTER" vs. "PRICE UTTER"), which could lead to unexpected results when querying for store data.

#### Unclear Columns
- **Date Format Variations:** The `PURCHASE_DATE` and `SCAN_DATE` fields have inconsistent formats, necessitating standardization.

### 3. **Product Data**

#### Quality Issues
- **Missing Category Data:** Some category columns (`CATEGORY_2`, `CATEGORY_3`) have missing or inaccurate values, such as Zyrtec being categorized as skincare.
- **Placeholder Manufacturer and Brand Data:** Some entries use placeholders like "PLACEHOLDER MANUFACTURER" and "BRAND NOT KNOWN" inconsistently, requiring a uniform approach.

#### Unclear Columns
- **Category Hierarchy:** The relationship between `CATEGORY_1` through `CATEGORY_4` is unclear and needs clear definitions.
- **Data Source Ambiguity:** The `BARCODE` field links products to transactions across multiple retailers. Adding a retailer column could help clarify categorization inconsistencies.
